# face-and-eye-detection-using-open-cv
This repository provides a robust solution for real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV, a leading open-source computer vision library. The project leverages Haar Cascade classifiers—an efficient, machine learning-based approach proposed by Viola and Jones—for accurately identifying faces and eyes in both images and live video streams
